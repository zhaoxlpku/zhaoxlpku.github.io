I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of Hong Kong, advised by Prof. [Lingpeng Kong](https://ikekonglp.github.io/). I earned my B.Sc. degree in [EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/xxkxjsxy/Home/HOME.htm) from Peking University in 2019 and my M.Sc. degree from [AAIS](http://www.aais.pku.edu.cn/en/enabout/), Peking University, advised by Prof. [Rui Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eLw6g-UAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Dongyan Zhao](https://www.wict.pku.edu.cn/zhaodongyan/en/). I have also interned at Microsoft STCA (2019-2020), Tencent AI Lab (2020-2022 & 2023-2024), and Sambanova Systems (2024).

My current research is centered on large language models (LLMs) post-training, with a focus on improving their reasoning abilities including theorem proving (ICML24), math (ACL24), and multi-modality (ACL24). Prior to the emergence of LLMs, my studies revolved around deep learning applications in the fields of open-domain dialogue systems (IJCAI19, EMNLP22, ACL23, KDD23, EMNLP23), retrieval-augmented dialogue systems (ICLR20, EMNLP20, ACL22, NAACL22, EMNLP22), video-grounded dialogue systems (EMNLP22), neuro-symbolic reasoning (ACL 23).
