I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of Hong Kong, advised by Prof. [Lingpeng Kong](https://ikekonglp.github.io/). I earned my B.Sc. degree in EECS at Peking University in 2019 and my M.Sc. degree in AAIS at Peking University in 2022, advised by Prof. [Rui Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eLw6g-UAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Dongyan Zhao](https://www.wict.pku.edu.cn/zhaodongyan/en/). I have also interned at Microsoft STCA (2019-2020), Tencent AI Lab (2020-2022 & 2023-2024), and Sambanova Systems (2024).

My current research is centered on large language models (LLMs) post-training, with a focus on improving their reasoning abilities including theorem proving (ICML'24), math (ACL'24), and multi-modality (ACL'24). Prior to the emergence of LLMs, my studies revolved around deep learning applications in the fields of open-domain dialogue systems (IJCAI'19, EMNLP'22, ACL'23, KDD'23, EMNLP'23), retrieval-augmented dialogue systems (ICLR'20, EMNLP'20, ACL'22, NAACL'22, EMNLP'22), video-grounded dialogue systems (EMNLP'22), and neuro-symbolic reasoning (ACL'23).
